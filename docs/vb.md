Paul Graham 在这篇文章中谈到，在孩童时期，他对于人生短暂这事很难理解。直到有了孩子，才有了真切地感受到。并确定是对的。

明白人生短暂的意义在哪里？在于，我们可以意识到，我们应该更有效地利用时间。不要把时间浪费在一些琐事上，一些无意义的事情上，一些不重要的人身上。利用好有限的时间，去做对自己更重要的事，更有意义的事，自己更关心的事情上。把时间花在对自己重要的人身上。

现代科技或现代社会，可能想抢夺你的注意力、你的时间。要意识到这一点。避免被短视频、碎片化信息抢占你的头脑，浪费你的时间，阻止你做重要的事情。

而什么是重要的事，时间应该花在哪里。这很考验一个人。考验他的思考能力，是否设定好自己的人生目标。这里有一个判断标准。那就是，再过几年，你还关注这件事吗。它对未来的几年后产生重要的影响了吗。

另外，我们总有一些琐事需要去做。为了谋生，我们需要做工作中的一些琐事。再比如我们需要吃饭填饱肚子，要做个人卫生清洁等。这些都会消耗我们的时间。对有些人来说，甚至这些时间都不太想花。可以有一些方案来避免。比如通过购买多套相同款式的衣服，避免在穿什么衣服这些事情上，浪费决策的注意力和时间。

现代社会，也有一些好处。你可以把一些工作外包出去，节省你的时间。比如，不用自己做饭，可以去餐厅吃，或者叫外卖。

## 正文

Life is short, as everyone knows. When I was a kid I used to wonder about this. Is life actually short, or are we really complaining about its finiteness? Would we be just as likely to feel life was short if we lived 10 times as long?

人生短暂，这是众所周知的。当我还是个孩子时，我曾对此感到好奇。人生真的短暂吗，还是我们只是在抱怨它的有限性？如果我们的寿命延长十倍，我们是否还会觉得人生短暂？



Since there didn't seem any way to answer this question, I stopped wondering about it. Then I had kids. That gave me a way to answer the question, and the answer is that life actually is short.

因为似乎没有办法回答这个问题，我停止了对它的思考。后来我有了孩子。这让我找到了回答问题的方法，答案是人生确实短暂。



Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time, into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year old. If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only get to watch your child experience it 8 times. And while it's impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity like time, 8 is not a lot of something. If you had a handful of 8 peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.

有了孩子让我知道如何将连续的数量，时间，转化为离散的数量。你只有52个周末可以和你两岁的孩子一起度过。如果圣诞节的魔力从3岁持续到10岁，你只有8次机会看着你的孩子体验它。虽然说像时间这样的连续数量很难说是多或少的，但8并不是很多。如果你手里只有8颗花生，或者书架上只有8本书可供选择，无论寿命多长，这个数量肯定看起来是有限的。



Ok, so life actually is short. Does it make any difference to know that?

好吧，所以人生确实短暂。知道这一点，有什么意义吗？



It has for me. It means arguments of the form "Life is too short for x" have great force. It's not just a figure of speech to say that life is too short for something. It's not just a synonym for annoying. If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.

这对我有意义。这意味着“人生太短暂而不去做某事”的争论有很大的力量。说人生太短暂而不去做某事不仅仅是一种比喻，它不仅仅是“烦人”的同义词。如果你发现自己想做某件事但时间不够，你应该尽可能地不去做这件事。



When I ask myself what I've found life is too short for, the word that pops into my head is "bullshit." I realize that answer is somewhat tautological. It's almost the definition of bullshit that it's the stuff that life is too short for. And yet bullshit does have a distinctive character. There's something fake about it. It's the junk food of experience. [1]

当我自问人生太短暂而不去做什么事时，我脑海中浮现的词是“无意义之事”（译者注：原文是 bullshit，这里翻译成无意义值事，在下文根据情况有时会翻译成琐事）。我意识到这个答案有点循环论证。无意义之事几乎就是人生太短暂而不去做的事情的定义。然而，无意义之事确实有其独特的特点。它有些假的东西。它是经验的垃圾食品。



If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that's bullshit, you probably already know the answer. Unnecessary meetings, pointless disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people's mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.

如果你问自己你在做什么无意义的事，你可能已经知道答案了。不必要的会议，毫无意义的争论，官僚作风，装模作样，处理别人的错误，交通堵塞，上瘾但无回报的消遣。



There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it's either forced on you, or it tricks you. To some extent you have to put up with the bullshit forced on you by circumstances. You need to make money, and making money consists mostly of errands. Indeed, the law of supply and demand ensures that: the more rewarding some kind of work is, the cheaper people will do it. It may be that less bullshit is forced on you than you think, though. There has always been a stream of people who opt out of the default grind and go live somewhere where opportunities are fewer in the conventional sense, but life feels more authentic. This could become more common.

这类事情以两种方式进入你的生活：它要么被强加给你，要么欺骗你。在一定程度上，你必须忍受环境强加给你的琐事。你需要赚钱，而赚钱大部分是苦差事。事实上，供求法则确保了：某种工作越有回报，人们就会越便宜地去做。也许你被迫接受的琐事比你想象的要少。总有一些人选择退出天生的环境，去生活在传统意义上机会更少的地方，但生活感觉更真实。以后这样的情况可能会变得更加普遍。



You can do it on a smaller scale without moving. The amount of time you have to spend on bullshit varies between employers. Most large organizations (and many small ones) are steeped in it. But if you consciously prioritize bullshit avoidance over other factors like money and prestige, you can probably find employers that will waste less of your time.

你可以在不搬家的小范围内做到这一点。你在无意义之事上花费的时间在雇主之间是不同的。大多数大型组织（和许多小型组织）都充满了无意义之事。但是如果你有意识地将避免无意义之事置于其他因素如金钱和声望之上，你可能会找到浪费你时间更少的雇主。



If you're a freelancer or a small company, you can do this at the level of individual customers. If you fire or avoid toxic customers, you can decrease the amount of bullshit in your life by more than you decrease your income.

如果你是自由职业者或小公司，你可以在个别客户层面上做到这一点。如果你解雇或避免有毒的客户，你可以减少很多生活中的无意义之事，并且你减少的收入不会很多。



But while some amount of bullshit is inevitably forced on you, the bullshit that sneaks into your life by tricking you is no one's fault but your own. And yet the bullshit you choose may be harder to eliminate than the bullshit that's forced on you. Things that lure you into wasting your time have to be really good at tricking you. An example that will be familiar to a lot of people is arguing online. When someone contradicts you, they're in a sense attacking you. Sometimes pretty overtly. Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself. But like a lot of instincts, this one wasn't designed for the world we now live in. Counterintuitive as it feels, it's better most of the time not to defend yourself. Otherwise these people are literally taking your life.

但是，虽然一定量的琐事不可避免地被强加给你，但通过欺骗你悄悄进入你生活的无意义之事，没有人的错，只是你自己的错。然而，你选择的无意义之事可能比强加给你的无意义之事更难消除。诱使你浪费时间的事情必须非常擅长欺骗你。一个对许多人来说都很熟悉的例子是在线争论。当有人反驳你时，他们在某种意义上是在攻击你。有时非常公开。当你被攻击时，你的本能是为自己辩护。但是像许多本能一样，这种本能并不适合我们现在生活的世界。反直觉的是，大多数时候不为自己辩护会更好。否则这些人真的在夺走你的生命。



Arguing online is only incidentally addictive. There are more dangerous things than that. As I've written before, one byproduct of technical progress is that things we like tend to become more addictive. Which means we will increasingly have to make a conscious effort to avoid addictions — to stand outside ourselves and ask "is this how I want to be spending my time?"

在线争论只是偶然上瘾的。还有比这更危险的事情。正如我以前写过的，技术进步的一个副产品是，我们喜欢的事物往往会变得更加上瘾。这意味着我们将越来越多地有意识地努力避免上瘾——站在我们自己之外，问“这是我想要花费时间的方式吗？”



As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things that matter. But different things matter to different people, and most have to learn what matters to them. A few are lucky and realize early on that they love math or taking care of animals or writing, and then figure out a way to spend a lot of time doing it. But most people start out with a life that's a mix of things that matter and things that don't, and only gradually learn to distinguish between them.

除了避免无意义之事，人们还应该积极寻找重要的事情。但对不同的人重要的事情是不一样的，而且大多数人都必须学会什么对他们重要。一些人很幸运，很早就意识到他们喜欢数学或照顾动物或写作，然后找出一种方法来花很多时间做这些事情。但大多数人开始时生活是重要事物和不重要事物的混合，并且只有逐渐学会区分它们。



For the young especially, much of this confusion is induced by the artificial situations they find themselves in. In middle school and high school, what the other kids think of you seems the most important thing in the world. But when you ask adults what they got wrong at that age, nearly all say they cared too much what other kids thought of them.

对于年轻人来说，这种困惑主要是由他们所处的人为环境引起的。在中学和高中，其他孩子对你的看法似乎是世界上最重要的事情。但是当你问成年人他们那个年龄做错了什么，几乎所有人都说他们太在乎其他孩子对他们的看法了。



One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yourself whether you'll care about it in the future. Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter. That's how it tricks you. The area under the curve is small, but its shape jabs into your consciousness like a pin.

区分重要事物的一个启发式方法是问自己你将来是否会关心它。通常有假象的事物会有一个尖锐的峰值，看起来很重要。那就是它欺骗你的方式。曲线下的面积很小，但它的形状像针一样刺入你的意识。



The things that matter aren't necessarily the ones people would call "important." Having coffee with a friend matters. You won't feel later like that was a waste of time.

重要的事情不一定是人们会称之为“重要”的事情。和朋友一起喝咖啡很重要。你以后不会觉得那是浪费时间。



One great thing about having small children is that they make you spend time on things that matter: them. They grab your sleeve as you're staring at your phone and say "will you play with me?" And odds are that is in fact the bullshit-minimizing option.

有小孩子的一个好处是，它们让你花时间在重要的事情上：他们。当你盯着手机看时，他们会抓住你的袖子说“你能和我玩吗？”而且很可能这确实是减少无意义之事的选项。



If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by surprise. And that is just what tends to happen. You take things for granted, and then they're gone. You think you can always write that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize the window has closed. The saddest windows close when other people die. Their lives are short too. After my mother died, I wished I'd spent more time with her. I lived as if she'd always be there. And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion. But an illusion it was. I think a lot of people make the same mistake I did.

如果人生短暂，我们应该预料到它的短暂会让我们感到惊讶。而这正是通常发生的事情。你理所当然地认为事情会一直在那里，然后它们就消失了。你以为你总是可以写那本书，或者攀登那座山，或者无论什么，然后你意识到窗口已经关闭了。最悲伤的窗口是在其他人去世时关闭的。他们的生命也很短暂。我母亲去世后，我希望我花更多时间和她在一起。我活得好像她总是在那里。而且她以她典型的安静方式鼓励了那种幻觉。但那是一种幻觉。我认为很多人犯了和我一样的错误。



The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by something is to be consciously aware of it. Back when life was more precarious, people used to be aware of death to a degree that would now seem a bit morbid. I'm not sure why, but it doesn't seem the right answer to be constantly reminding oneself of the grim reaper hovering at everyone's shoulder. Perhaps a better solution is to look at the problem from the other end. Cultivate a habit of impatience about the things you most want to do. Don't wait before climbing that mountain or writing that book or visiting your mother. You don't need to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn't wait. Just don't wait.

避免被某事惊讶的通常方式是有意识地意识到它。在生活更加不稳定的时候，人们过去常常以现在看起来有点病态的程度意识到死亡。我不确定为什么，但似乎不断地提醒自己死神在每个人的肩膀上徘徊并不是正确的答案。也许更好的解决方案是从另一端看问题。培养一种对你最想做的事情不耐烦的习惯。不要等到攀登那座山或写那本书或拜访你的母亲。你不需要不断地提醒自己为什么不应该等待。



I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much of something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has. Both make sense here.

当你没有很多东西时，人们会做两件事：试图得到更多，并且品味你所拥有的。这两件事在这里都讲得通。



How you live affects how long you live. Most people could do better. Me among them.

你的生活方式会影响你的寿命。大多数人可以做得更好。我也是其中之一。



But you can probably get even more effect by paying closer attention to the time you have. It's easy to let the days rush by. The "flow" that imaginative people love so much has a darker cousin that prevents you from pausing to savor life amid the daily slurry of errands and alarms. One of the most striking things I've read was not in a book, but the title of one: James Salter's Burning the Days.

但你通过更密切地关注你所拥有的时间，可能会得到更大的效果。日子很容易匆匆而过。那些富有想象力的人非常喜欢的“流动”有一个更黑暗的表亲，它阻止你在每天的琐事和警报的泥潭中停下来品味生活。我所读过的最引人注目的事情之一不是在一本书中，而是一本书的标题：詹姆斯·索尔特的《燃烧岁月》。



It is possible to slow time somewhat. I've gotten better at it. Kids help. When you have small children, there are a lot of moments so perfect that you can't help noticing.

在某种程度上，你可以让时间慢下来。我已经变得更擅长了。孩子们帮助我做到这点。当你有小孩子时，有很多时刻如此完美，你不禁会注意到。



It does help too to feel that you've squeezed everything out of some experience. The reason I'm sad about my mother is not just that I miss her but that I think of all the things we could have done that we didn't. My oldest son will be 7 soon. And while I miss the 3 year old version of him, I at least don't have any regrets over what might have been. We had the best time a daddy and a 3 year old ever had.

感觉你已经从某种经历中挤出了所有的东西也有帮助。我为我母亲感到难过的原因不仅仅是我想念她，而是我想到所有我们可以一起做的事情，但我们没有。我的大儿子很快就要7岁了。虽然我想念他3岁时的样子，但至少我没有遗憾，因为可能发生的事情。我们度过了一个爸爸和一个3岁孩子所能度过的最美好的时光。



Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. That's what you do when life is short.

无情地削减无意义之事，不要等待去做重要的事情，并且品味你所拥有的时间。当人生短暂时，这就是你要做的。



## 注释

[1] At first I didn't like it that the word that came to mind was one that had other meanings. But then I realized the other meanings are fairly closely related. Bullshit in the sense of things you waste your time on is a lot like intellectual bullshit.

 [1] 最初我不喜欢我脑海中浮现的词是另一个含义的词。但后来我意识到其他含义相当接近。你在琐事上浪费的时间和你在智力上的无意义之事有很多相似之处。



[2] I chose this example deliberately as a note to self. I get attacked a lot online. People tell the craziest lies about me. And I have so far done a pretty mediocre job of suppressing the natural human inclination to say "Hey, that's not true!"

 [2] 我故意选择这个例子作为自我提醒。我在网上经常被攻击。人们告诉我关于我的最疯狂的事情。 而且到目前为止，我在抑制自然人类倾向说“嘿，那不是真的！”方面做得相当平庸。
